            This study aims at analysing the notion of Ubuntu as a contribution to 
            think about democracy, especially the crisis it faces in Brazil, before 
            the current historical reality of intolerance, racial discrimination, 
            social exclusion, and dehumanization. For this reason, we raise the following 
            question: can Africa contribute to think about democracy through her lifeâ€™s 
            philosophy expressed in Ubuntu? The first part of the text analyses the concept 
            of Ubuntu, highlighting its philosophical character. The second part develops two 
            structural characteristics of Ubuntu: community and tolerance. The research methodology 
            is characterised as a bibliographical work, whose contribution is a philosophical 
            analysis of the expression Ubuntu, based on the African way of life, from the 
            works of Ramose: African Philosophy Through Ubuntu (2005); of Gyekye: Person 
            and community in African thought (2003). We defend that understanding Ubuntu 
            as an African way of life, based on interdependence, inter-constitution, 
            interconnection and inter-humanisation is to contribute to think about 
            democracy as an ethical, social and political way of life that recognises 
            and considers the other(s) as individual(s) of differences that make humanisation possible.
